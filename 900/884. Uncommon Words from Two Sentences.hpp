// 884. Uncommon Words from Two Sentences
// We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

// A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

// Return a list of all uncommon words. 

// You may return the list in any order.

 

// Example 1:

// Input: A = "this apple is sweet", B = "this apple is sour"
// Output: ["sweet","sour"]
// Example 2:

// Input: A = "apple apple", B = "banana"
// Output: ["banana"]
 

// Note:

// 0 <= A.length <= 200
// 0 <= B.length <= 200
// A and B both contain only spaces and lowercase letters.
